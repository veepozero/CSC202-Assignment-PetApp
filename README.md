# Starting code for CSC202 Assignment

## Build configuration

The build configuration is in Kotlin (recommended by the industry), instead of Groovy (as textbook).

The build.gradle.kts files have all required libraries and packages for the project. You don't need to add libraries for new features required by the assignment.

In short, if you are not familiar with gradle build files, please keep them untouched.
